# Advanced Programming 2 - Ex 2

In this task we implemented our server and made the client side work using it.

Most features are the same as the last task but we added some:
- Deleting a contact is possible
- Adding/Deleting contact and sending messages are now working live when 2 users are connected at the same time
- If you got a message from someone you will get notified about it (a little circle will appear on his box)
- Your chats are being sorted by date always (either if you sent a message or got one)

# How to run

- access the server. run: cd Server
- install the node moduls. run: npm i
- make sure port 5000 is free and mongodb is installed on your computer
- activate the server. run: node app.js
- browse to localhost:5000
- enjoy:)
